      <h3>Our story</h3>
      <p>
        Le marche is the product of an idea to help those budding student
        entrepreneurs who are learning how to create business but their sales
        have been hit hard due to the ongoing pandemic. The idea is also the
        product of my most recent work experience with such students at an
        organization called Junior Achievement of B.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        This easy to use web-app is designed to give full power and encourage
        these young entrepreneurs, who are just below the age of majority, to
        have the opportunity to continue learning and growing their business by
        providing them with a platform to sell on the internet.
